             <h1>Flights and getting there</h1>
             <br>
             <h4>Air</h4>
             <p>Budget airlines have improved Skopje's modest number of air connections, and it's now connected pretty well to major European cities. Wizz Air still flies Skopje-London, but has stopped its Ohrid-London flights, and the Skopje-Barcelona connection was stopped as of autumn 2018.</p>
             <p>See the Airports of Macedonia website (www.airports.com.mk) for information about flying in and out of Macedonia, including timetables, carriers and weather conditions.</p>
             <h6>Airports and airlines</h6>
             <p>Skopje International Airport, 21km from Skopje, is Macedonia's main airport, though Ohrid's St Paul the Apostle Airport also runs a number of European international flight services.</p>
             <p>Skopje airport has exchange offices, ATMs and hotel-booking and car-rental services. Ohrid airport has kiosks for most major car-rental companies, too, which open for customers who have booked ahead.</p>

             <h4>Land</h4>
             <br>
             <h6>Bus</h6>
             <p>International routes generally arrive at and depart from Skopje or Ohrid. Pristina, Tirana, Sofia, Belgrade and Thessaloniki are the most common connections.</p>
             <p>From Skopje it's also possible to get to Ljubljana, İstanbul and Zagreb; some Ohrid buses travel to various destinations in Montenegro.</p>
             <br>
             <h6>Car & Motorcycle</h6>
             <p>Bringing your own vehicle into Macedonia is hassle free, though you do need a Green Card (proof of third-party insurance, issued by your insurer) endorsed for Macedonia. You also need to bring the vehicle registration/ownership documents.</p>
             <p>Note that petrol stations are not always located within spitting distance of Macedonia's border crossings, but the country isn't large and you're unlikely to get more than 25km or so without finding a pump.</p>
             <br>
             <h4>Train</h4>
             <p>Macedonian Railway runs antiquated trains. They are often the cheapest mode of transport and the most iconic way to travel, passing through wild terrain, however the network is limited and trains are less frequent than buses.</p>
             <p>Trains connect Skopje to Pristina, Belgrade and Thessaloniki (though the last is via a train-and-bus combo because of the fraught relationship with Greece).</p>
             <br>
             <h4>Sea</h4>
             <p>Macedonia is land-locked and it's not possible to get here by boat. The country's land borders run through Lake Ohrid and Lake Prespa, but it is illegal to cross at either of these places.</p>

                 <h4>Customs Regulations</h4>
                 <p>Objects of historical or cultural worth, such as archaeological finds, ethnological or historical pieces, and original art, require a certificate of origin that should be provided when you make your purchase; some may require a special licence. The certificate needs to be presented to customs authorities at the border when you leave. The rules do not apply to reproductions. For more information visit www.customs.gov.mk.</p>
                 <p></p>
                 <h4>Passport</h4>
                 <p>Some travellers have reported being denied entry to Serbia from Macedonia if they have a stamp from Kosovo in their passport.</p>

                          <p>When cycling on the roads in towns, you must have front and back lights.</p>
