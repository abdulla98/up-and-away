                  <h1>Activities</h1>
                  <p>The potential for outdoor activities is endless, but a lack of tourist infrastructure makes it difficult to do much independently in Macedonia. Hiking, paragliding, mountain biking and horse riding are all possible with a bit of planning.</p>
                  <h4>Hiking</h4>
                  <p>Hiking trails are scribbled across the landscape from north to south and east to west (particularly in Galičica, Pelister and Mavrovo National Parks), but invariably the trail markers are not well maintained. Proceed with caution at all times.</p>
                  <p>Hiking guides cost from between €50 and €80 a day, or consider investing in a GPS if you want to do any serious walking in the country. Balkan Hiking Adventures (www.balkanhikingadventure.com) is a network of 37 cross-border trails between Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania, and an excellent online resource with downloadable maps for a number of trails around Lake Ohrid and in the Baba Mountains (Pelister National Park). A good organisation for tailored tours with professional guides is Hiking The Balkans (www.hikingthebalkans.com).</p>
                  <p>Macedonia is chronically affected by summer wildfires. Hikers should check conditions in advance – if you get stuck in the wrong patch of forest, it could not only be dangerous, it could also be illegal if firefighters or park wardens have closed the area. Information on wildfires are communicated on the news service.</p>

                  <h1>Eating </h1>
                  <p>Growing up in an Macedonia, I got to experience all of the goods. From desserts to main dishes and spreads, Macedonian cuisine is a lot more than you might think. Below, I’ve gathered some of my current (and childhood) favourites that I think everyone needs to try.</p>

                            <h5 class="card-title">Burek</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">A delicious and savoury puff pastry that will fulfill your love/hate relationship with carbs. Some typical fillings for burek include feta cheese, spinach, minced meat and/or potatoes. Yes, the more carbs, the better.

                              <h5 class="card-title">Tavce Gravce</h5>
                              <p class="card-text">Any child who grew up in a Macedonian household knows very well that this was certainly not your preferred choice of dinner. However, as you grew into the fine, well rounded and cultured adult you are today (one can only dream, right?), you have acquired the taste for this hearty dish. Tavce gravce (literally meaning beans cooked in a skillet) is a thick and chunky bean stew that is cooked in the traditional Macedonian earthenware. Tavce gravce has a variety of different spices and vegetables that enhance its flavour, including fresh Macedonian paprika.

                                <h5 class="card-title">Kebapi</h5>
                                <p class="card-text">You can smell Ćevapi from a mile away, and once you do you’re running for the kitchen or barbeque. Ćevapi is essentially minced meat shaped like small sausages, which means you can eat way more than just two and not feel THAT bad. Traditionally they are cooked on a wooden charcoal grill, but barbeques or even a good old pan on the stove will do.

                                  <p class="card-text">This dessert is sweet and delicious. Quite similar to churros, Tulumba is a deep fried batter and soaked in syrup. They’re usually in bite-sized pieces so you can easily grab one (two, or three) and just pop them in your mouth. Tulumba is normally eaten cold and is actually a favourite in many areas of the Balkans.

                                    <p class="card-text">Okay, so this is not technically a dish on its own. However, when combined with the magical power of feta cheese and warm, oven fresh bread, ajvar can totally justify as a meal. Ajvar is a delicious relish like blend consisting of roasted red bell peppers, paprika and garlic. If you're in Canada, you can usually find this in the international aisle of your local grocery store.

                                      <p class="card-text">Also called flija, it is a layered pancake having flour, butter, water, yogurt and oil as its main ingredients, served with honey and yogurt or even pickled vegetables, jam and cheese. The specialty of this dish lies in the method of its preparation since it is made using a sac (spherical metal lid). Eaten to celebrate births, weddings or other auspicious ceremonies, March 18 is celebrated as the Flia day in Albania where the nearest kith and kin are called upon to prepare and eat Flia together.

                                        <p class="card-text">In the village of Galičnik, the waitress at the Hotel Neda recommended the kačamak so forcefully, that it sounded like a command. Cowed into compliance, I ordered it. Soon, she set down a bowl of clumpy, semi-mashed curds of cornmeal, with two big slices of goat cheese and a portion of freshly-made cream. The description isn’t entirely appealing, I’ll admit, but this was delicious. The pasta-like curds go perfectly with the cheese, and the cream was heavenly. So now, I’m commanding you: if you are in Galičnik, go to the Hotel Neda and order the kačamak. Do as you’re told… you’ll thank me, later.
