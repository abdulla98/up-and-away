        <!-- Excerpt -->
        <p class="dark-grey-text">Skopje has plenty of charm. Its Ottoman- and Byzantine-era sights are focused around the city's delightful Čaršija, bordered by the 15th-century Kameni Most (Stone Bridge) and Tvrdina Kale Fortress – Skopje's guardian since the 5th century. Don't miss the excellent eating and drinking scene in Debar Maalo, a lovely tree-lined neighbourhood.<span id="dots">...</span></p>
        <span id="more">
            <p>For most of its existence, Skopje has been a modest Balkan city known for its rich local life, but the last decade has seen its centre transformed into a bizarre set design for an ancient civilisation. Towering warrior statues, gleaming, enormous neoclassical buildings, marble-clad museums, hypnotic megafountains…and plenty of lions.</p>
          <p>This is the result of a controversial, nationalistic project called 'Skopje 2014' implemented by ex–Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski. Some of the buildings along the riverbank are already suffering flooding and have unsteady foundations.</p>

Towering above the town, covered in snow until July and as early as September, is Macedonia’s second highest mountain, Titov Vrv (Tito’s Summit, 2,748m).This is in fact the highest mountain that lies completely in Macedonia (and was also the highest in the whole of Yugoslavia, thus earning it its name). The higher peak of Mount Korab (2,764m) lies further to the south above Lake Mavrovo on the border with Albania.<span id="dots1">...</span> </p>
        <span id="more1">
          <p>Nestled close to Kosovo and Albania, Tetovo is the de facto capital of Macedonia’s significantly sized Albanian minority. It is also the headquarters of the main Albanian-centred political parties, the Democratic Union of Integration and the Democratic Party of Albanians. Just outside Tetovo is the South East European University, Macedonia’s third largest university after Skopje and Bitola.</p>

        <!-- Excerpt -->
        <p class="dark-grey-text">Sublime Ohrid is Macedonia's most seductive destination. It sits on the edge of serene Lake Ohrid, with an atmospheric old quarter that cascades down steep streets, dotted with beautiful churches and topped by the bones of a medieval castle. Traditional restaurants and lakeside cafes liven up the cobblestone streets, which in high summer can be very lively indeed. Outside of July and August, the tourist circus subsides and the town becomes more lived in.<span id="dots2">...</span></p>
        <span id="more2">
          <p>
            Ohrid is small enough to hop from historic monuments into a deck chair and dip your toes in the water – a lovely little town beach and boardwalk make the most of the town's natural charms. A holiday atmosphere prevails all summer, when it's a good idea to book accommodation in advance. Ohrid's busiest time is from mid-July to mid-August, during the popular summer festival.

              Buttressing Pelister National Park, elevated Bitola (660m) has a sophistication inherited from its Ottoman days when it was known as the 'City of Consuls'. Macedonians wax lyrical about its elegant buildings, nationally important ruins and cafe culture – yet as far as tourists are concerned it's still a little off the beaten track.
          
              Crumbling and colourful 18th- and 19th-century townhouses, coupled with an authentic, workaday Čaršija (Old Ottoman Bazaar), make Bitola worth a day trip or an overnight stay if you've made it as far as Pelister's westerly mountains for some hiking.<span id="dots3">...</span></p>
              <span id="more3">
            <p>
              Join the locals in sipping a coffee and people-watching along pedestrianised Širok Sokak, the main promenade and heart of the city, and explore the wonderful Čaršija. Don't miss visiting the ancient ruins of Heraclea Lyncestis, one of the country's best archaeological sights

            <p class="dark-grey-text">Lake Ohrid, in its vastness and mystery, is a monumentally seductive attraction. Mirrorlike and dazzling on sunny days, it's a truly beautiful place – especially in and around the ancient town of Ohrid, with its cobbled streets, distinctive architecture, city beach and lake-front bars.<span id="dots4">...</span></p>
            <span id="more4">

            At 300m deep, 34km long and three million years old, shared by Macedonia (two-thirds) and Albania (one-third), Lake Ohrid is among Europe's deepest and oldest. The Macedonian portion is inscribed on the Unesco World Heritage list for its cultural heritage and unique nature – it's considered the most biodiverse lake of its size in the world.
            To the east of Ohrid lies Galičica National Park with mountain villages and Magaro Peak, which can be summited. To the south, a long, wooded coast has pebble beaches, churches and camping spots. In summer the big, resort-style hotels and beaches can be unpleasantly crowded but there are better spots beyond them.</p>

The Popova Sapka ski resort, represents the most visited tourist destination allover the Tetovo region. The road is in the middle between the settlement and the ski terrain, that rise up on the opposite sides.

            <span id="more6">
            <p>Churches, chapels and monasteries have long been guarded by these forested mountains, though most have now been left to rack and ruin. Many of the modern-day villages in this area are majority Macedonian Albanian Muslim, though the population is sparse.</p>

            <p>These days, locals and tourists alike come to walk the breadth of the canyon and dip a toe in the tempting clear waters of the dammed lake. Brace yourself: the temperature hovers at around 14°C year-round.</p>

            <p>Canyon Matka is a popular day trip from Skopje and crowded at weekends; if you want peace and quiet, come very early or stay overnight.</p>

            <p class="dark-grey-text">Macedonia's winery heartland, Tikveš has produced wine since the 4th century BC. The bacchanalia of wine-making was suppressed during Ottoman rule, and things did not pick up again until all the way into the 1980s when vines were finally replanted and production ramped up. This area benefits from 300 sun-filled days a year, making it the perfect wine region.<span id="dots7">...</span></p>
            <span id="more7">
            <p>The rolling vineyards and their attached wineries make for a great driving tour. They are also lakes, caves, gorges and churches to see along the way. Touring independently can be difficult since some of the wineries are badly signposted. Base yourself at the wonderful Popova Kula Winery hotel and restaurant, the region's shining star for appreciating the grapes.</p>

            <p>Tikveš' major towns are Kavadarci and Negotino – both small and pleasantly provincial. Kavadarci's main claim to fame is that it's home to the nation's beloved Tikveš Winery.</p>

Beautiful vistas abound, and the park is home to Macedonia's highest peak, Mt Korab (2764m). Locally the park is best known for its ski resort (the country’s biggest) near Mavrovo town, but by international standards the skiing is fairly average. In summertime, it's glorious.<span id="dots8">...</span></p>
            <span id="more8">
            <p>One of Macedonia's most important – and accessible – monasteries, Sveti Jovan Bigorski, is here, as are the atmospheric villages of Galičnik and Janče, separated by a mountain ridge. The Galičnik traditional village wedding is one of the country's most popular and quirky summer festivals. Mavrovo is also home to some of Macedonia’s most revered cheesemakers.</p>

            <p>Driving in the park is extremely scenic, but a word of caution: car GPS doesn't work well here and signposting is poor.</p>

            <p>Pelister's 88 tree species include the rare five-leafed molika pine. It also hosts endemic Pelagonia trout, deer, wolves, chamois, wild boars, bears and eagles.</p>              <p>In WWI, the foothills were used by the Macedonian Front, and it was here and Bitola that bore the brunt of the country's involvement in the war – now commemorated in a moving history trail within the park.</p>
              <p>Pelister has excellent village guesthouses nearby and is just 30 minutes away by car from historic Bitola. With its fresh alpine air and good day hikes, the park is an underrated Macedonian stopover.</p>
